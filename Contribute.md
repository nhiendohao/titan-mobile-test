This guide documents the best way to make various types of contribution, including what is required before submitting a code change.
Contributing to LINE VN QA doesnâ€™t just mean writing code.
Helping new users on the communication channel, testing releases, and improving documentation are also welcome. 
In fact, proposing significant code changes usually requires first gaining experience and credibility within the community by helping in other ways. 
This is also a guide to becoming an effective contributor.
So, this guide organizes contributions in order that they should probably be considered by new contributors who intend to get involved long-term. Build some track record of helping others, rather than just open pull requests.
